# python-exercise-generator

## Introduction
A python program for generating linear algebra exercises and their solutions.
A latex file is created.
The numpy and sympy python packages are needed to run the program.

## Supported exercises
1. Eigenvalue problems: Characteristical polynom, eigenvalues, eigenvectors.
2. Gram schmidt orthogonalization: Orthogonalization of vector basis with the gram schmidt orthogonalization process.
3. Linear equations: System of linear equations.
4. Recursive equations: Determination of the closed form of recurrence equations with linear algebra methods.
5. Determinant: Calculation of the determinant of a matrix.
6. Polynom division
7. Gram schmidt orthonormalization: Orthonormalization of vector basis with the gram schmidt orthonormalization process.

## Generating exercises
Use "python generator.py -h" for an explanation.
